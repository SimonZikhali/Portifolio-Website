                    <p> I started organising Church events in the younth depertment and

                        Singin had always been my passion, since i was young.I only started my proffesional journey of singing Acapella Music in 2008 as part of the Albert Luthuli Brothers,                         
                        In 2016 I saw that children in my community needed help with their studies but had nobody to help. I then join Funda Helping Program to help those who were in need.
